    name: The Rain Man

    description: 
    mythP1: "Begorotire was a happy Indian. One day, however, having been wronged
      in the hunting division, he was furious, deciding that he would leave in search
      of another place to live. He cut the hair of his wife and daughter, painting
      the whole family with a black dye he had taken from the genipap fruit. He took
      a heavy, sturdy piece of wood, making the first Caiap\xF3 club, with the handle
      braided in black and the tip stained with the blood of the game. He then reached
      the top of a mountain, carrying his weapon, and began to scream. His screams
      sounded like heavy thunder. He swung the club sharply in the air and lightning
      flashed from its ends. Amidst the noise and lights, Begorotire soared into
      the skies. The frightened Indians shot their arrows, but nothing could prevent
      the Indian from disappearing into the sky. The clouds, also frightened, poured
      rain. That's why Begorotire became the rain man. Later, he took the whole family
      to heaven, where they lacked nothing, and from there he did much to help those
      who remained on earth. He gathered seeds from his bountiful gardens, dried
      them on the girau, giving them to a daughter to bring. "
    mythP2: "The Indian descended inside a huge gourd tied to a long rope, woven
      with the plant's own branches. Walking through the forest, a young man found
      the gourd, tied it with vines and pieces of wood and, with the help of his
      friends, took it to the village. The mother, opening the gourd, found the Indian
      woman, the daughter of the rain, who was thin and had long hair, having remained
      there for a long time. The young woman was taken out and fed, and her hair
      was trimmed. When asked, the daughter of rain explained why she had come, giving
      them the seeds sent by her father and making everyone very happy. The young
      man who found the gourd married the girl, and the girl began to live on earth
      again. Eventually, he decided to visit his parents. He asked her husband to
      bend a Pinda\xEDba foot, bringing the canopy to the ground. He sat on it, and
      when the tree was released, the Indian was thrown into the sky. When he returned,
      he brought with him the whole family and baskets full of bananas and other
      wild fruits. Begorotire taught everyone how to grow the seeds and tend the
      gardens, then returned to his new home. Even today, when plants need water,
      the rain man causes thunder, causing it to fall on the gardens to keep them
      always green and abundant. "

    name: Pequi Leyend
    region: 
    description: 
    mythP1: "A Lenda do Pequi tells the story of the fruit of the love of the Tain\xE1-Racan
      and Malu\xE1 Indians. Tain\xE1-Racan was a beautiful Indian and Malu\xE1 a
      young and beautiful warrior who fell in love as soon as he saw her. Shortly
      thereafter, they were married. Their lives were as beautiful and happy as the
      flowering ip\xEA. Every morning, Malu\xE1 went out to hunt and fish, while
      Tain\xE1-Racan weaved and cooked to offer to her lover when he returned. Beside
      him, an alligator always lay down, keeping him company and talking, because,
      at that time, the animals also talked. The time was passing. After three years
      of marriage, lying on a large rock by the calm river, they asked themselves
      why Cananxiu\xE9 still hadn't sent the long-awaited son. Two small rivers of
      tears ran down Taina-Racan's flushed cheeks. Malu\xE1 embraced Taina-Racan
      and loved her. Moons later, when the ip\xEAs began to bloom again, Uadi, the
      Rainbow, was born. He was beautiful, but there was something different about
      him that amazed his father, mother, the entire tribe: Uadi had golden hair
      like the flowers of the yellow ip\xEA. Malu\xE1 welcomed the birth of his son
      with joy and to explain his difference, spread throughout the tribe that Uadi
      was the son of Cananxiu\xE9. However, the Indians of his tribe mocked him,
      saying that Uadi was the son of the alligator. Oblivious to malicious jokes,
      the boy grew up full of charm, joy, and an unusual intelligence. One day, Malu\xE1
      was called to say goodbye, his little arms wrapped around his father's neck,
      and he said: \u201CDaddy, I'm leaving too. I'm going to my mother's house,
      up in heaven\u201D. The warrior's body shuddered. At that moment, Cananxui\xE9,
      came down from the sky in the form of Andrerura \u2013 the red macaw, and shouted
      loudly: \u2013 \u201CI came to get my son!\u201D. Tain\xE1-Racan and Malu\xE1
      fell to their knees. The warrior opened his arms shouting \u2013 \u201CGive
      me back my son!\u201D Malu\xE1's cry echoed through the forest, hurting the
      silence with pain. Malu\xE1 left and Taina-Racan wept three days and three
      nights. "
    mythP2: "The alligator, his friend, who came from the forest when he heard his
      cries of pain, would lie at his door, day and night, taking care of her. One
      night, the alligator begged Cananxiu\xE9 to have mercy, promising to leave
      forever, never to speak to humans again, and to live only on the banks of rivers,
      if he would make her happy again. Hearing him, Cananxiu\xE9 took the body of
      a red macaw again and returned to Earth, saying to Taina-Racan: \u2013 \u201CFrom
      your tears a plant will be born, which will grow like a leafy tree. It will
      give such fragrant flowers that pacas, deer, capybaras and wolves will come
      to eat on moonlit nights. Then, fruits will be born. Inside the green shell,
      the fruits will be golden like the hair of Wadi. But the seed will be full
      of thorns, like the thorns of the pain of your mother's heart. Your scent will
      be as unforgettable as you will always be for your alligator friend. And whoever
      tastes it will never forget it.\u201D Tain\xE1-Racan smiled and immediately
      saw a plant grow, which he called Tamau\xF3. The same one that the Mehinako
      Indians of the Xingu know as akain; and that white men from the North, Northeast
      and Midwest call Pequi. And when Malu\xE1 returned, she found a beautiful and
      leafy tree, full of fruits, called a pequizeiro. He took some from the ground,
      broke them, removed the golden kernels and ate them, with flour, along with
      Taina-Racan. And then they made love right there in the shade of the pequi
      tree. This is how, for many years to come, whenever the ip\xEA and cashew trees
      returned to bloom in the forests and the pequi trees also dropped their ripe
      fruits on the ground, serving as food for everyone, Tain\xE1-Racan and Malu\xE1
      were blessed with more children. . And for each child that was born, they planted
      another pequi tree. And they had many children. And they lived happily ever
      after. The name pequi, py (skin) + qui (thorn), with origin in the Tupi language
      refers to the thorns in the core, in its scientific name Caryocar brasiliense
      Cambess, the genus Caryocar comes from the Greek caryon (core or nut) + kara
      (head ), referring to the globose fruit, the specific epithet brasiliense is
      given because this species is originally from Brazil. "

    name: "Carna\xFAba Legend"
    region: 
    description: 
    mythP1: "Of Tupi origin, as it refers to the God Tup\xE3, the legend tells the
      origin of carnauba, carnaubeira or carna\xEDba (Copernicia prunifera or cerifera),
      a palm native to the Brazilian Caatinga regions and common throughout the Northeast,
      which saved a people from extinction. The story tells that these people lived
      happily with Nature, the sun warmed the huts and ripened the fruits, the clouds
      gave shade, the rain wet the plants and increased the rivers. Over time, however,
      the sun began to get very hot: so hot that it dried up rivers, killed plants
      and animals. The people prayed, danced and begged Tup\xE3 to send the rain
      again, but the sun kept burning everything. Then people began to die, until
      that strong people only left a couple and their son, forced to abandon their
      lands in search of better ones. Chewing the roots that were left to them, they
      walked all night, and when again the sun burned in the sky, the boy saw a palm
      tree alone, in what looked like a desert, swaying its green palms. Exhausted,
      they stopped to rest in the shade of that palm tree and the parents fell asleep.
      Only the son was still awake and worried, asking Tup\xE3 for help. It was when
      he heard a voice and saw, at the top of the palm tree, an Indian woman, who
      said to him: \u201CMy name is Carnaubeira. I'm here to help you. Many years
      ago my tribe was also plagued by drought. I helped everyone, and when I died,
      the moon turned me into this tree destined to save the helpless. Do what I
      advise you and you will still be happy. Hew my trunk, and with my sap, quench
      your parents' thirst and yours. Eat my fruits, and you won't be hungry anymore.
      Cook some of my roots, and medicine that, drunk, closes the wounds."
    mythP2: "Put my leaves to dry and beat them, a gray and fragrant powder will
      come out of them, my wax, with which you will be able to light your way on
      moonless nights. From the straw that remains, weave your hat and mat. Now,
      I make a request of you: plant my coconuts so that you have a carnaubal, then
      you can build your hut with the wood of my trunk.\u201D The boy did everything
      the India advised him to do. Within a few years, a huge carnauba tree swayed
      in the wind, and the little Indian, now a man, said goodbye to his parents
      to take the coconuts from this \u201Ctree of life\u201D to all the villages.
      Endemic to the semi-arid region of Northeast Brazil, Copernicia prunifera or
      cerifera can reach 10 to 15 meters in height, with thin trunks that are sometimes
      prickly at the base or covered with dried leaves. Also called carna\xEDba,
      carna\xEDva, carna\xFAva and carnanda\xFAba, the popular names of the carnauba
      tree derive from the Tupi karana\xFDwa. In addition to being the symbol tree
      of the state of Cear\xE1, where it is abundantly found, the importance of carnauba
      was recognized by great Brazilian writers such as M\xE1rio de Andrade, Jos\xE9
      de Alencar and Euclides da Cunha. According to legend, carnauba can be used
      in its entirety: the roots, bark and fruits are used to produce food and natural
      remedies; wood is excellent for rafters, joists or battens used in construction
      and furniture; leaves become straw for crafts; and its famous wax, known as
      \"queen of waxes\" for its quality and resistance, has wide practical use,
      including on an industrial scale. "

    name: Buriti Palm Tree Myth
    region: 
    description: "A long time ago, the Buriti dos Lopes region was inhabited by numerous
      indigenous tribes. The most respected of them was a village of Tapuias that
      were commanded by the chief Airuan\xE3 who had settled in the region of the
      Muriti creek (as the Buriti creek was called at the time). The natives lived
      happily planting, swimming, hunting and fishing and at night they gathered
      in the yard by the fire to celebrate and tell stories of their adventures.
      One night, Araci, the chief's daughter, wanted to know from her father how
      the first palm tree in the region had been born, among many that were offered
      to them by nature. The father then told the story: Tup\xE3 had in his hands
      the first seed of Muriti and decided to give it to our nation as a gift. But
      Mauari, an evil spirit, seeing his intentions, wanted to know where the seed
      would be planted and what it would be called. Sensing Mauar\xED's envy, Tup\xE3
      paid no attention to his questions and ignored him. Then he gave the seed to
      the Indians telling them that from the seed the largest of all palm trees would
      grow, which would be the queen of the forest. She told them that the residents
      should preserve and respect the existence of the palm tree and, with her name,
      they should name those lands, so that it would become as imposing as the plant.
      From the planted seed, the first buriti palm was born. From this, others emerged,
      giving rise to a vast buritizal plantation. The palm tree had several uses:
      its bunches of more than two meters in length, its rounded fruits with a ruby-red
      scale, it gives a golden yellow pulp, used to make pamonhas, juices, oil and
      sweets. The straw serves as a cover for the hollows, the voluminous stream
      with a strong current irrigates everything, supplying the roots of the palm
      trees with pure water. Mauar\xED, envious as he was, could not be at peace
      in the face of the happiness of the Indians, and, taken by rage that Tup\xE3
      had not listened to him, he decided to curse those lands: \u201CWhen greed
      and envy speak louder, when men become greedy for power and no longer respect
      each other, this harmony and plenty will come to an end. The waters will dry
      up, the fire will burn, the soil will become poor and these palm trees will
      no longer produce.\u201D Tup\xE3, upon learning of the bad omen, prophesied:
      \u201CThe gift I gave cannot be tarnished. I believe that there will always
      be men of good will and of good heart who will do everything to prevent this
      curse. The noble palm trees will resist as long as possible and will remain
      standing, as long as there is hope in the defense of their lives.\u201D To
      protect the palm trees of Buriti, Tup\xE3 created an entity to protect the
      palm trees of this species in the buritizais. According to Rafael Noleto, \u201CMaster
      Buriti (\u2026) is a figure linked to the springs and swamps of the region\u201D.
      The entity is usually seen amidst the buritizais of Piau\xED on nights of full
      moon, carrying a staff and some buritis in its hands. But if something is threatening
      the palm trees it protects, it could appear at any time. His magical powers
      allow him to bless not only the buritizais, but also business and personal
      life, bringing abundance to the good-hearted men who worship him and respect
      the buritizais biome. That is why, until today, Buriti is the symbol tree of
      the city of Buriti dos Lopes, because as long as there are men of good heart
      who respect nature, the buritizais will spread not only in those lands, but
      throughout Piau\xED, under the protection by Master Buriti. Due to the growth
      of Buritizais, in addition to Buriti dos Lopes, other cities in Piau\xED, in
      addition to Buriti dos Lopes, received their name as a tribute to this palm
      tree. This is the case of Canto do Buriti, Palmeira do Piau\xED and Buriti
      dos Montes."

    name: "A\xE7a\xED Leyend"
    region: 
    description: "Itaki, then chief of the tribe, was forced to make a rather radical
      decision that left everyone worried and shocked. As a way of controlling the
      number of inhabitants, the chief decided that all children born after a certain
      date should be sacrificed. For him, this would be a way to contain the population
      increase of his tribe. One day, the drastic measure befell Itaki's own family.
      His daughter Ia\xE7\xE3 gave birth to a child who soon had to be sacrificed
      to enforce his grandfather's decisions. Ia\xE7\xE3 suffered too much with the
      death of her little daughter. It is said that she spent days and days without
      coming out of her hollow, suffering and crying nonstop for several days and
      nights. Thus, Ia\xE7\xE3 raised her thoughts to Tup\xE3, an indigenous deity,
      and asked him to make her father find another way to solve the issue of food
      provision, without the need for the sacrifice of children. Tup\xE3 was very
      touched by the Indian's pain and decided that he would help Itaki to find another
      solution to the tribe's problem. It was then that, one day, Ia\xE7\xE3 heard
      the cry of a child coming from outside its hollow. As she left, to her surprise
      and happiness, she spotted her little daughter next to a palm tree. Ia\xE7\xE3
      ran towards her and hugged the girl who, mysteriously, disappeared in her mother's
      arms. Once again inconsolable, Ia\xE7\xE3 cried so much during the night that
      he lost his strength and ended up dying. The body of Itaki's daughter was found
      the next morning, hugging the palm tree. Ia\xE7\xE3 had a serene face and seemed
      to smile slightly. Her eyes were open and directed toward the top of the tree.
      When observing the palm tree, Itaki noticed that in the place where Ia\xE7\xE3's
      eyes were directed, there was an abundance of a small dark fruit. It was a\xE7a\xED.
      The chief then ordered that all the fruits be harvested. With these fruits,
      a juice with a reddish appearance and quite thick was made, which fed the population
      of the tribe and ended the food shortage. It is said that the name of the fruit
      was a tribute that the chief paid to his daughter. The leafy tree and its fruit
      were named a\xE7a\xED, which is Ia\xE7\xE3 in reverse. Since then, a\xE7a\xED
      has \u200B\u200Bbeen used as food for the entire tribe of the chief Itaki and
      this has caused him to suspend his order to sacrifice the children born to
      control population growth and the consequent food shortages."

    name: "Sama\xFAma Legend"
    region: 
    description: "Of Ticuna origin, which is considered one of the most numerous
      peoples in the Amazon, spreading across Brazil, Peru and Colombia, the best
      known legend of Sama\xFAma is about the origin of light in the world. According
      to the Ticuna/Tikuna people, who came from the Eware creek, near the Solim\xF5es
      River, at the beginning of the Earth it was all night and the people suffered
      from the cold and darkness. It was believed to be a large sama\xFAma, or wotchine,
      which blocked the sunlight with its branches and leaves. It was then that Yo'i
      and Ipi decided to throw the pits of another tree, the tucupi macaw (Parkia
      multijuga), to try to open holes in the dense foliage. The points of light
      that crossed the sama\xFAma and the night are the stars. Yo'i and Ipi could
      also see a sloth (Choloepus didactylus) that lived in the canopy of the sama\xFAma,
      attaching its branches to the sky. To bring more light, they needed to scare
      the animal away. As they couldn't do it alone, they called all the animals
      in the forest to help. Some versions say that it was a small coatipur (Sciurillus
      pusillus), Taine, who managed to climb the tree and use fire ants to scare
      away the royal sloth and topple the Sama\xFAma. The Ticuna also say that the
      Solim\xF5es River was born from the trunk of the fallen samaumeira, and from
      its branches, the streams were born. They also say that after a while, Yo'i
      and Ipi saw that the stump (nap\xFCne) of the tree was sprouting and they were
      afraid of it growing and blocking the sun again. To prevent it, they placed
      a tortoise on top of the tocoi to eat its leaves, but it was not enough and
      the sama\xFAma continued to grow. Then they got very close and heard Sama\xFAma's
      heart still beating. From this heart, which was taken and replanted with the
      help of other animals, the umari or tetchi (Geoffroea spinosa) was born. Other
      legends of lesser-known origin say that a healer and protector of the forest
      lives within its roots, the Sapopemas, which can reach 2 meters in height and
      30 meters in length, radiating around the tree. Others believe that there is
      a portal to these giant roots. Legends involving the Curupira also mention
      the use of Sapopemas to communicate with animals and forest peoples, using
      them as a drum. Native from Mexico to the Amazon Basin in South America, including
      the Caribbean, the sama\xFAma (Ceiba pentandra) can reach 70 meters in height
      and live for hundreds of years, often being considered the \u201Cqueen\u201D
      or \u201Cmother\u201D of the forest. It is sacred to many Amerindian peoples,
      including the Mayans, who called it Yaaxche. Another variation of the species
      (Ceiba pentandra var guineensis) is native to West Africa, indicating its ancestry
      in relation to the formation of current ecosystems. For this reason, it has
      many names: mafumeira, kapok, silk tree, kapok, pulin, malpanka, ora, bongo,
      kumaka, lupuna, oc\xE1 (S\xE3o Tom\xE9 and Pr\xEDncipe) and poil\xE3o (Guinea-Bissau).
      In addition to the medicinal properties of the sama\xFAma, it is known for
      storing water that is used for other animals and plants. On the other hand,
      the umizeiro \u201Cpours\u201D water from its leaves to moisten the earth around
      it."

    name: Cassava Legend
    region: 
    description: With contagious joy, Mani was a very esteemed Indian girl by the
      Tupi tribe where she lived. She was the granddaughter of the chief and her
      mother's pregnancy was a cause of sadness for the chief of the tribe. That
      was because she had become pregnant and was not married to a brave warrior,
      as he wished. The chief forced the daughter to say who the father of her child
      was, but the Indian woman said that she did not know how she had become pregnant.
      The daughter's dishonesty greatly displeased the chief. Until one day, he had
      a dream that advised him to believe in his daughter, because she remained pure
      and told the truth to her father. Since then, he accepted the pregnancy and
      was very happy with the arrival of his granddaughter. One morning, Mani was
      found dead by her mother. She had simply died in her sleep and, even lifeless,
      had a smiling face. Saddened by the loss, her mother buried Mani inside her
      hollow and her tears moistened the earth as if she were being watered. A few
      days later, in that same place, a plant was born, different from all the ones
      she knew, which she started to take care of. Noticing that the earth was getting
      cracked, she dug in hopes that she could dig up her daughter alive. However,
      she found a root, manioc, which was named after the junction of the name Mani
      and the word hollow.
