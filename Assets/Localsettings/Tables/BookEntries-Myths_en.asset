    m_Localized: Begorotire was a happy Indian in Brazil, but one day he became angry
      and decided to look for a new home. He painted his family black with the dye
      from the jenipap fruit and created a magic staff. He climbed a mountain, waved
      his staff and soared into the sky, becoming the Rain Man. From there, he helped
      those left on earth, sending seeds to his daughter through a gourd.

    m_Localized: "Begorotire's daughter was found by a young man in the calabash
      and returned to the village. She married him and, with her father's help, brought
      prosperity to all. The daughter taught how to cultivate the seeds and care
      for the fields. However, she was homesick and decided to visit her parents
      in heaven. She used a Pinda\xEDba tree, bending its top to the ground and launching
      herself into the sky. He returned with his family and baskets full of fruit."

    m_Localized: Begorotire taught everyone to take care of the fields and keep them
      green and plentiful. To this day, as the Rain Man, he brings rain to the fields
      when the plants need water. This legend from Brazil teaches us about the importance
      of valuing nature, working together and being grateful for the blessings we
      receive from the rain. It invites us to care for the earth and to be aware
      of how our connection with nature can bring prosperity and joy to our lives.

      happily. Their names were Tain\xE1-Racan and Malu\xE1. After three years of
      marriage, they longed to have a child, until finally Uadi was born, a boy with
      golden hair like the flowers of the yellow ipe tree. Although he was special,
      Uadi was teased by the tribe, who said he was the son of the alligator that
      was always near Tain\xE1-Racan. Despite the jokes, Wadi grew up to be charming
      and gifted with exceptional intelligence."

      sun that dried up everything in its path. A couple and their son were forced
      to leave their land in search of a new home. During their journey, the son
      found a solitary carnauba palm in the middle of the desert. Under its shade,

      him to use the sap of the palm to quench his thirst, to eat the fruits to avoid
      hunger, to use the roots as medicine and to obtain wax from the leaves to light
      his way in the dark nights. In addition, he asked the young man to plant the
      carnauba coconuts to help other villages.

      \"palm of life\" to nearby villages, fulfilling Carnaubeira's request and hoping
      that these fruits would bring help and salvation to those who received them.
      The legend of the carna\xFAba teaches us about the importance of the wisdom
