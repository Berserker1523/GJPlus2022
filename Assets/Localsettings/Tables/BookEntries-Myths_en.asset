    m_Localized: Begorotire was a happy Indian in Brazil, but one day he became angry
      and decided to look for a new home. He painted his family black with the dye
      of the jenipap fruit and created a magic staff. He climbed a mountain, waved
      his staff and soared into the sky, along with his family, becoming the Rain
      Man. From there, he helped those left on earth, sending his daughter with seeds,
      through a gourd.

      happily. Their names were Tain\xE1-Racan and Malu\xE1. After three years of
      marriage, they longed to have a child, until finally Uadi was born, a boy with
      golden hair like the flowers of the yellow ipe tree, which frightened his parents
      and the whole tribe. Malu\xE1 received the birth of her son with joy and to
      explain her difference she spread the word throughout the tribe that Uadi was
      the son of Cananxiu\xE9, Uadi was mocked by the tribe, who said he was the
      son of the alligator that was always near Tain\xE1-Racan. Despite the jokes,
      Uadi grew up to be charming and gifted with exceptional intelligence."

      sun that dried up everything in its path. A couple and their son were forced
      to leave their land in search of a new home. During their journey, the son
      found a solitary carnauba palm in the middle of the desert. Under its shade,

      him to use the sap of the palm to quench his thirst, to eat the fruits to avoid
      hunger, to use the roots as medicine and to obtain wax from the leaves to light
      his way in the dark nights. In addition, he asked the young man to plant the

      that these fruits would bring help and salvation to those who received them.
      The legend of the carna\xFAba teaches us about the importance of the wisdom
