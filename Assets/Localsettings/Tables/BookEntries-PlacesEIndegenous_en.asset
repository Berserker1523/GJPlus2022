      in the world. It stretches across several South American countries, such as
      Brazil, Peru and Colombia. It is a magical place full of tall trees, rushing

    m_Localized: This rainforest is known as the "green lung" of our planet because
      it produces a large amount of oxygen. The trees and plants of the Amazon perform
      a process called photosynthesis, in which they convert carbon dioxide into
      oxygen, helping to maintain the balance of the air we breathe. It's as if the
      Amazon is giving us the fresh air we need to live!

    m_Localized: However, the Amazon faces challenges and threats. Deforestation,
      which is when trees are cut indiscriminately, threatens the balance of this
      unique ecosystem. There are also activities such as illegal mining and poaching,
