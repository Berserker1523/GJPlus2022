    m_Localized: "Begorotire was a happy Indian. One day, however, having been wronged
      in the hunting division, he was furious, deciding that he would leave in search
      of another place to live. He cut the hair of his wife and daughter, painting
      the whole family with a black dye he had taken from the genipap fruit. He took
      a heavy, sturdy piece of wood, making the first Caiap\xF3 club, with the handle
      braided in black and the tip stained with the blood of the game. He then reached
      the top of a mountain, carrying his weapon, and began to scream. His screams
      sounded like heavy thunder. He swung the club sharply in the air and lightning
      flashed from its ends. Amidst the noise and lights, Begorotire soared into
      the skies. The frightened Indians shot their arrows, but nothing could prevent
      the Indian from disappearing into the sky. The clouds, also frightened, poured
      rain. That's why Begorotire became the rain man. Later, he took the whole family
      to heaven, where they lacked nothing, and from there he did much to help those
      who remained on earth. He gathered seeds from his bountiful gardens, dried
      them on the girau, giving them to a daughter to bring. "

      with the plant's own branches. Walking through the forest, a young man found
      the gourd, tied it with vines and pieces of wood and, with the help of his
      friends, took it to the village. The mother, opening the gourd, found the Indian
      woman, the daughter of the rain, who was thin and had long hair, having remained
      there for a long time. The young woman was taken out and fed, and her hair
      was trimmed. When asked, the daughter of rain explained why she had come, giving
      them the seeds sent by her father and making everyone very happy. The young
      man who found the gourd married the girl, and the girl began to live on earth
      again. Eventually, he decided to visit his parents. He asked her husband to
      bend a Pinda\xEDba foot, bringing the canopy to the ground. He sat on it, and
      when the tree was released, the Indian was thrown into the sky. When he returned,
      he brought with him the whole family and baskets full of bananas and other
      wild fruits. Begorotire taught everyone how to grow the seeds and tend the
      gardens, then returned to his new home. Even today, when plants need water,
      the rain man causes thunder, causing it to fall on the gardens to keep them
      always green and abundant. "

    m_Localized: "Pequi Legend tells the story of the fruit of the love of the Tain\xE1-Racan
      and Malu\xE1 Indians. Tain\xE1-Racan was a beautiful Indian and Malu\xE1 a
      young and beautiful warrior who fell in love as soon as he saw her. Shortly
      thereafter, they were married. Their lives were as beautiful and happy as the
      flowering ip\xEA. Every morning, Malu\xE1 went out to hunt and fish, while
      Tain\xE1-Racan weaved and cooked to offer to her lover when he returned. Beside
      him, an alligator always lay down, keeping him company and talking, because,
      at that time, the animals also talked. The time was passing. After three years
      of marriage, lying on a large rock by the calm river, they asked themselves
      why Cananxiu\xE9 still hadn't sent the long-awaited son. Two small rivers of
      tears ran down Taina-Racan's flushed cheeks. Malu\xE1 embraced Taina-Racan
      and loved her. Moons later, when the ip\xEAs began to bloom again, Uadi, the
      Rainbow, was born. He was beautiful, but there was something different about
      him that amazed his father, mother, the entire tribe: Uadi had golden hair
      like the flowers of the yellow ip\xEA. Malu\xE1 welcomed the birth of his son
      with joy and to explain his difference, spread throughout the tribe that Uadi
      was the son of Cananxiu\xE9. However, the Indians of his tribe mocked him,
      saying that Uadi was the son of the alligator. Oblivious to malicious jokes,
      the boy grew up full of charm, joy, and an unusual intelligence. One day, Malu\xE1
      was called to say goodbye, his little arms wrapped around his father's neck,
      and he said: \u201CDaddy, I'm leaving too. I'm going to my mother's house,
      up in heaven\u201D. The warrior's body shuddered. At that moment, Cananxui\xE9,
      came down from the sky in the form of Andrerura \u2013 the red macaw, and shouted
      loudly: \u2013 \u201CI came to get my son!\u201D. Tain\xE1-Racan and Malu\xE1
      fell to their knees. The warrior opened his arms shouting \u2013 \u201CGive
      me back my son!\u201D Malu\xE1's cry echoed through the forest, hurting the
      silence with pain. Malu\xE1 left and Taina-Racan wept three days and three
      nights. "

      his cries of pain, would lie at his door, day and night, taking care of her.
      One night, the alligator begged Cananxiu\xE9 to have mercy, promising to leave
      forever, never to speak to humans again, and to live only on the banks of rivers,
      if he would make her happy again. Hearing him, Cananxiu\xE9 took the body of
      a red macaw again and returned to Earth, saying to Taina-Racan: \u2013 \u201CFrom
      your tears a plant will be born, which will grow like a leafy tree. It will
      give such fragrant flowers that pacas, deer, capybaras and wolves will come
      to eat on moonlit nights. Then, fruits will be born. Inside the green shell,
      the fruits will be golden like the hair of Wadi. But the seed will be full
      of thorns, like the thorns of the pain of your mother's heart. Your scent will
      be as unforgettable as you will always be for your alligator friend. And whoever
      tastes it will never forget it.\u201D Tain\xE1-Racan smiled and immediately
      saw a plant grow, which he called Tamau\xF3. The same one that the Mehinako
      Indians of the Xingu know as akain; and that white men from the North, Northeast
      and Midwest call Pequi. And when Malu\xE1 returned, she found a beautiful and
      leafy tree, full of fruits, called a pequizeiro. He took some from the ground,
      broke them, removed the golden kernels and ate them, with flour, along with
      Taina-Racan. And then they made love right there in the shade of the pequi
      tree. This is how, for many years to come, whenever the ip\xEA and cashew trees
      returned to bloom in the forests and the pequi trees also dropped their ripe
      fruits on the ground, serving as food for everyone, Tain\xE1-Racan and Malu\xE1
      were blessed with more children. . And for each child that was born, they planted
      another pequi tree. And they had many children. And they lived happily ever
      after. The name pequi, py (skin) + qui (thorn), with origin in the Tupi language
      refers to the thorns in the core, in its scientific name Caryocar brasiliense
      Cambess, the genus Caryocar comes from the Greek caryon (core or nut) + kara
      (head ), referring to the globose fruit, the specific epithet brasiliense is
      given because this species is originally from Brazil. "

      the origin of carnauba, carnaubeira or carna\xEDba (Copernicia prunifera or
      cerifera), a palm native to the Brazilian Caatinga regions and common throughout
      the Northeast, which saved a people from extinction. The story tells that these
      people lived happily with Nature, the sun warmed the huts and ripened the fruits,
      the clouds gave shade, the rain wet the plants and increased the rivers. Over
      time, however, the sun began to get very hot: so hot that it dried up rivers,
      killed plants and animals. The people prayed, danced and begged Tup\xE3 to
      send the rain again, but the sun kept burning everything. Then people began
      to die, until that strong people only left a couple and their son, forced to
      abandon their lands in search of better ones. Chewing the roots that were left
      to them, they walked all night, and when again the sun burned in the sky, the
      boy saw a palm tree alone, in what looked like a desert, swaying its green
      palms. Exhausted, they stopped to rest in the shade of that palm tree and the
      parents fell asleep. Only the son was still awake and worried, asking Tup\xE3
      for help. It was when he heard a voice and saw, at the top of the palm tree,
      an Indian woman, who said to him: \u201CMy name is Carnaubeira. I'm here to
      help you. Many years ago my tribe was also plagued by drought. I helped everyone,
      and when I died, the moon turned me into this tree destined to save the helpless.
      Do what I advise you and you will still be happy. Hew my trunk, and with my
      sap, quench your parents' thirst and yours. Eat my fruits, and you won't be
      hungry anymore. Cook some of my roots, and medicine that, drunk, closes the
      wounds."

      will come out of them, my wax, with which you will be able to light your way
      on moonless nights. From the straw that remains, weave your hat and mat. Now,
      I make a request of you: plant my coconuts so that you have a carnaubal, then
      you can build your hut with the wood of my trunk.\u201D The boy did everything
      the India advised him to do. Within a few years, a huge carnauba tree swayed
      in the wind, and the little Indian, now a man, said goodbye to his parents
      to take the coconuts from this \u201Ctree of life\u201D to all the villages.
      Endemic to the semi-arid region of Northeast Brazil, Copernicia prunifera or
      cerifera can reach 10 to 15 meters in height, with thin trunks that are sometimes
      prickly at the base or covered with dried leaves. Also called carna\xEDba,
      carna\xEDva, carna\xFAva and carnanda\xFAba, the popular names of the carnauba
      tree derive from the Tupi karana\xFDwa. In addition to being the symbol tree
      of the state of Cear\xE1, where it is abundantly found, the importance of carnauba
      was recognized by great Brazilian writers such as M\xE1rio de Andrade, Jos\xE9
      de Alencar and Euclides da Cunha. According to legend, carnauba can be used
      in its entirety: the roots, bark and fruits are used to produce food and natural
      remedies; wood is excellent for rafters, joists or battens used in construction
      and furniture; leaves become straw for crafts; and its famous wax, known as
      \"queen of waxes\" for its quality and resistance, has wide practical use,
      including on an industrial scale. "
